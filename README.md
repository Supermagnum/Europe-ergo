# Europe-ergo
A 94 key ergonomic,split keyboard.
Its powered by 2X Raspberry pico and linked with two 5 pin D sub connectors.
It uses tht components.

The reset switches, 5 pin D sub connectors and raspberry pico's  goes on the reverse side of the Pcb's.

The L1/L2 button is to change from  Norwegian QWERTY to Norwegian Dvorak.
There are relevant LEDs that lights up depending on what layer is active.

PWM1 to PWM 5 controls LED's ( ON/OFF) based by the active layer, and also caps lock and scroll lock active.

The right side has identical outputs for PWM.

Cherry MX switches fit the PCB'S.
